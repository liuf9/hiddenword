## Introduction
Acrostic is a type of practice to form a "meaningful structure" by the first letter of subsequent lines of the poem. 
Commentators throughout the years tried to find acrostics and interpreted their appearances in different Latin texts. 
With the resource of a plain txt file of *A Latin Dictionary* (edd. Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short) shared by
<tt>Telemachus</tt> from github, I have made a program that can shorten the searching processes of acrostics and
provide as the output a list of words that are potentially made acrostics by Latin authors. Further validations on
their appearances require the readers to look back into the actual verses of Latin texts and interpret their nearby
circumstances with allusions or any other literary devices.
